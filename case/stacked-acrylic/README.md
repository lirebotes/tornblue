# Stacked Acrylic Plate Case

This is a high-profile case made of a stack of laser-cut acrylic/metal sheets. It supports a 5 column TornBlue keyboard. An optional stack of layers can be used to add tenting and store the battery.

With the exception of the switch plate, each layer is cut from 3mm acrylic. The switch plate is 1.5-1.6mm and can be cut from either acrylic or metal.
