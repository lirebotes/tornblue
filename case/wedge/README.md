## 3d Printed Case

### Plate

There is a 3d printable plate for MX switches. Remember to print and fit this before soldering your switches.

### MX Switch Wedge Case

You can 3d print a wedge case for your Tornblue using the follow files:

| 5 cols | 6 cols |
|--|--|
| [5_Base.3mf](case/wedge/5_Base.3mf) | [6_Base.3mf](case/wedge/6_Base.3mf) |
| [5_Wall.3mf](case/wedge/5_Wall.3mf) | [6_Wall.3mf](case/wedge/6_Wall.3mf) | 

First print Base.3mf. This is the support for the PCB. *You must print this first before the wall.*

Second print Wall.3mf. The wall prints upside down, so the visible surface is on the print bed. This print will pause at layer 113 (about 4 hours into the print on a prusa mk3). You now need to fit the base upside down into the wall. This will be a snug fit. Make sure that the base fits perfectly around all the edges before continuing the print. If everything works the next layer will bridge over the edge of the base, creating one print.

You can fit two layers of 4mm car tyre balance weights in the case. Each side will weight around 350g. The weights improve the sound profile and feel of the keyboard.

Carefully add the PCB and battery into the case. Secure with four short m2.5 screws.

Repeat this for the right side of the case, but make sure to print the parts mirrored.

_rev0: You will need to enlarge the cutout for the USB cable on the right side._
